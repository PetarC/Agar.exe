# Agar.exe
Agar.exe is an almost complete clone of Agar.io, but offline, written in C++, and complete with an AI (to make things less boring). The name is a reference to Agar.io, which is a website, whereas a .exe is an executable... in case you didn't know.

##Planned features
* Basic cell/blob movement
* "Food", which will probably just be named agar, that cells can absorb
* Infinite world, no edges no corners
* "Viruses" that can either split you or protect you (depending on size).
* NPC cells that roam around, absorb agar, and may chase you from time to time
* Windows and Linux support
* Multiplayer is planned, but is extremely very far off. It will probably be the very last thing added, if at all. If implemented, multiplayer will not be online servers available to everyone (as currently seen on the real Agar game), but rather a server side and a client side that allows anyone to set up a server.

##Misc
This project is partly because I really want an offline version of Agar.io, and partly as a technical test. I have a prototype game engine that I'd like to test out, and this is a pretty good way to do it. There might eventually be semi-cringeworthy stuff here (I'm not exactly a professional...), but I hope not!
